# Angular_notpad
TypeScript Code
This part is the Angular component associated with the HTML. It imports the required dependencies, defines the NotepadComponent, and initializes two variables: newNote (to store the user's input) and currentDate (to display the current date and time).

The addNote function is called when the user submits the form. It logs the new note to the console, clears the newNote field, and updates the currentDate with the current date and time.

In summary, this code creates a simple notepad interface using Angular and HTML. Users can enter notes, submit them, and see the current date and time when they added the note. The styling is defined using CSS to make the interface visually appealing.
